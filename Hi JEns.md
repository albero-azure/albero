Hi Jens

Thank you for transparency and productive meeting on Friday.
Can I just summarize what we have discussed.

1. There will be several CTO-like roles on EMEA scale aligned with main sales motions. Their main responsibilities will be ones discussed on a previous meeting and highlighted within the document.
2. These roles will be virtual and will be allocated to the teams where the person taking this role currently sits. Meaning that the person will be directly reporing to his/her manager (probably with dotted line to the sales lead for the initiative).
4. Roles won't have a special title so will be remain TS as well as won't have elevation in level / change of compensation.

Is my understanding correct?

Best regards, Andrei.
