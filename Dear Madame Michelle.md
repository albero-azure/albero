Dear Madame Michelle

Thank you for the email and informing us.
I am writing this email in English as my other languages are less effective when it comes to discussing sensitive subjects.

I would like to express our strong concern over the way our school addresses the current situation. 

First of all, I see and can admit that the situation in the class becomes worse and it affects now all the pupils and their families which is not something we would like to experience during these particular hard times. 

Secondly, I am very concerned that the amount of cooperation games affects the ability to cover the program for a year thus puts additional pressure on pupils and lowers their chances to have good grades and education in the future.

I am getting the consistent feedback that the pedagogue running the cooperation games talks disrespectfully to the kids, threatns them and puts a lot of preassure worsening the situation. I am seriously concerned that continuing in the same way will harm my kids mental health. 

Having said that and acting as a legal representative of my son I am asking for the following:
1. Provide us with the outcome of the recent actions taken to mitigate the current flashes of violence from the certain kids.
2. Provide us with the mandate from the Stop Bulling and the concrete plan of actions - what will be the timeframe and expected amount of hours spent for solving the problems.
3. Provide us with the report of the current actions taken by the Stop Bulling organization 

I acknowledge that
