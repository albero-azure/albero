      Once upon a time there was a high-throughput HTAP system. It was based on some well-known technology. Engineers decided to bring this system to the cloud and Azure Synapse was chosen as the destination technology. The PoC, MVP and main migration went smoothly (almost ðŸ˜‰). Suddenly technical teams started experiencing degrading performance of the entire system. Needless to say, that the users were not very happy with this. After careful consideration they discovered that growing commit queue was causing performance degradation. Having reviewed of the code, they found out that individual commits were the main root cause for the issue. So, they understood that MPP system is not the best option for individual transactions. Luckily, nobody got hurt in the process.
