      Storing all the data “forever” is one of my favorite business requirements. One company just took this approach too directly with Cosmos DB. They never did cleanups so their main collection was growing organically over the years. More data – more partitions. More partitions – more RUs required to support the same performance level. More RUs – more cost. “What for are you using all this stockpiled data?” – they were asked. “We don’t” – was the reply. Cool, right? At least they were able to refer to their collection as, probably, one of the largest in the world.
